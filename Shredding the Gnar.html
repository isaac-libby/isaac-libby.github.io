	As I was acclimating myself with college I quickly noticed a problem. Walking sucked. All around me people were pushing themselves around on longboards, and instantaeously  I saw the apeal. So I ordered a board off of amazon for 50 bucks and in a couple of days I was shredding. As much fun as I had it all came to a crashing halt on a rainy night in Orono. As I was just minding my own buisness just shredding some gnar, all of a sudden the board shot out from under me. Straight into the road it rolled, untill it came to a grinding snapping stop underneath the wheels of a giant white truck. That was the end of my career as a Profession Gnar Shredder.
