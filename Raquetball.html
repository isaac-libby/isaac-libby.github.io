		In my spare time I have very recently taken up the soprt of raquetball. As I was exploring the New Balance Rec Center with my roomate, we came across these courts in the upper loft. As we were naturally curious we checked them out and was instantly intreseted in playing the game. We then looked up the rules and quickly began playing games. At first we were pretty terrible. But we quickly got better and soon we were doing multiple volleys before points were scored. As we made more friends here at UMaine we invitged them to play as well. After teaching them how to play we were able to have more diverse games and more variety in the style of play. Currently my roomate is beating me 8-6.
