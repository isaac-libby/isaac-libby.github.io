		<p> As I was checking out IMLeague (which is a site for intramural sports on campus) I stumbled upon Co-Ed Ultimate Frisbee. Instantly I was hooked. As my roomate and I have been playing pick-up games of ultimate throughout the first couple weeks of college we already had a base of players we could call upon to form our team. So we already had an advantage on the other teams as ours was a well oiled machine by the time the first game came to play. Quickly teams began to fall left and right to the might of the Dirty Dro, teams were left crushed under our titanic heel! As the season came to an end we were the undefeated and undisputed champions of the league.
